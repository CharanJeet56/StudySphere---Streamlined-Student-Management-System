# StudySphere - Streamlined Student Management System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In today's digital age, educational institutions face challenges in efficiently managing student data and fostering communication between students and faculty. Traditional methods often lead to mismanagement of records, lack of accessibility, and inefficient workflows. The StudySphere project addresses these issues by providing a centralized platform that streamlines the processes of user registration, student management, and data retrieval.

### 1.2 Objective
The primary objective of the StudySphere project is to create a user-friendly Student Management System (SMS) that:
- Facilitates user registration and login.
- Enables authorized users (e.g., teachers or admins) to manage student records (add, update, delete).
- Provides an intuitive interface for displaying student information.
- Incorporates secure database interactions using SQL to ensure data integrity.

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1 Features
The system includes the following key features:
- **User Registration:**
  - Users can register by providing their name, email, and password.
  - The system validates input to ensure proper formatting and uniqueness of email addresses.
- **User Login:**
  - Registered users can log in securely.
  - The system supports session management to track logged-in users.
- **Student Management:**
  - Admin users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.
  - The system allows adding new students, updating existing records, and deleting student information.
- **Display Students:**
  - Any user can view the list of registered students, providing transparency and accessibility.

### 2.2 Technologies Used

## 4. Project Architecture

### 4.1 System Architecture
The application employs a three-tier architecture:
- **Presentation Layer:** Console-based interface for user interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Contains the core functionalities, implemented in Java.
- **Data Access Layer:** Manages all interactions with the MySQL database.

### 4.2 Database Design
The database comprises the following tables:
1. **Users Table:**
   - Columns: `id` (Primary Key), `name`, `email` (Unique), `password`.
   - Stores information about registered users.
   
2. **Students Table:**
   - Columns: `id` (Primary Key), `name`, `email` (Unique).
   - Contains details of students managed by the system.
   
3. **Teachers Table:**
   - Columns: `id` (Primary Key), `name`.
   - Holds information about teachers.
   
4. **Quizzes Table:**
   - Columns: `id` (Primary Key), `title`.
   - Tracks quizzes associated with students.

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1 Code Overview
The core functionalities of the application are implemented across several classes:
- **Main Class:**
  - Entry point of the application.
  - Manages user interactions via console input and output.

  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          LearningManagementSystem lms = new LearningManagementSystem();
          Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
          int choice;

          do {
              System.out.println("1. User Registration");
              System.out.println("2. User Login");
              System.out.println("3. Display Students (Anyone can see)");
              System.out.println("4. Exit");
              System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
              choice = scanner.nextInt();
              scanner.nextLine();  // Consume the newline character

              // User choice handling
          } while (choice != 4);
          scanner.close();
      }
  }
  ```

- **LearningManagementSystem Class:**
  - Contains methods for user registration, login, and student management.
  - Handles database interactions using JDBC.

- **DBConnection Class:**
  - Manages the connection to the MySQL database.

  ```java
  public class DBConnection {
      private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lms_db?useSSL=false";
      private static final String USER = "root";  // MySQL username
      private static final String PASSWORD = "********";  // MySQL password

      public static Connection getConnection() {
          // Connection handling code
      }
  }
  ```

### 5.2 Sample Code
Here’s a sample code snippet for user registration, showcasing input validation and error handling:

```java
public void registerUser(String name, String email, String password) {
    String query = "INSERT INTO users (name, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
    try (Connection conn = DBConnection.getConnection();
         PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {
        pstmt.setString(1, name);
        pstmt.setString(2, email);
        pstmt.setString(3, password);
        pstmt.executeUpdate();
        System.out.println("User registered successfully!");
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        System.out.println("Error registering user: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Testing Strategies
The testing phase involved several strategies to ensure the reliability of the application:

- **Unit Testing:** Each method was tested independently to verify correctness.
- **Integration Testing:** Examined the interactions between various modules and the database.
- **System Testing:** Validated the entire application against the initial requirements.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Engaged actual users to evaluate the application’s usability and functionality.

### 6.2 Test Cases
Here are a few examples of test cases executed during the testing phase:

| Test Case ID | Description           | Input Data                                     | Expected Output                       | Actual Output                       | Status |
